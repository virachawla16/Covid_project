# Covid_project
 <h2>This is my program based on the theme of COVID-19 that includes a library that I have not used before.</h2>


<h3>Description:</h3>

My project is a control based game. In the game, the player has to escape the infected people and move away from them. Throughthis game the player can learn about social distancing and also the use of masks. In my game, when a regular person comes to close to the infected person , the screen goes red. This teaches the players about social distancing. 


<h3>Interaction:<h3>

<h4>The user is able to actually play the game and also learn about the virus at the same time.</h4>
