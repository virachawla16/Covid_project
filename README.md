# Covid_project
 <h2>This is my program based on the theme of COVID-19 that includes a library that I have not used before..</h2>


<h3>Description:</h3>

My final project is "____________" It is a control based game. In the game, the player has to escape the coronavirus and during the game the player can collect powerups such as a mask, handsanitizers etc...


<h3>Interaction:<h3>

<h4>The user is able to actually play the game and also learn about the virus at the same time as the 'powerups' in the game actually help in realy life.</h4>
